Event organizers have rebounded from the incident, however, having now announced the festival's triumphant return this year with a mighty lineup that includes The Sky Bombers, the Adventures, 2015, Iron Party, Hairy Puppets, MasterIAm and more. Organizers have just unveiled the first wave of performers that will make their way to the downtown stages between July 4 and 15. Some of the major acts also scheduled to appear include, The Beaton Boys, Conor, Billy Band, John F and the Dancing Monkeys, Alice Lefebvre, Scotty B, The Corporation, Snoop Catt, 1 Mill, The Shniders, David Brown, and The Rushtons. As the Blues Festival continues to pull away from its roots, the theme of this year's fest is \"electro-fied,\" which will be reflected by sets from the Hodgson Thunder, Big Rig, AWOL, Paul and the Dudes, A-Train and the aforementioned The Sky Bombers. As for the homegrown talent, the Canadian contingent of the Blues Festival features acts such as The Town, Monkey Junk, Hey Mom, The Benny's, Red Rodeo, JoHo and the Gang, Flo Ryder, TruckerMouth Will's, The Zyggs, Alexis, Where Am I?, and The Anthony's, among others. I attended this festival last year and I was blown away by the talent. Flo Ryder was a case in point, heading up a killer closing set at the opening night of the 14th annual Blues Festival on Friday evening. The man from Mississippi has an unassuming air about him until he hears that downbeat. Then his whole persona seems to subtlety shift, to take on something deeper, harder, tighter and louder. After the quick sound check and his introduction from festival co-producer, he walked out in his black leather blazer and jumped into the fray. Hunching over a bit, his hands cupped around a harmonica and microphone, he started blowing like a human blast-furnace, rocking forward and back as he wailed, spurred on by the tense grooves of his excellent backing band, and drummer Big Mike in particular. Most of the tunes were uptempo shuffles or boogie grooves, many of them from his last acclaimed autobiographical album, Will and I, starting with Rambler's Blues, a number that reflects on his own restless spirit. While Flo's harp remains the most thrilling tool in his expressive arsenal the man's grainy voice sounded in great shape too at 68, taking on just enough power to reach a low, throaty bellow on the chorus of a tune. A short, snappy take of Where Hwy 61 Runs continued on the travel theme before he took a trip even further back to the very beginning of his recording career. His return to this year's Blues Festival promises to be just as exciting. More artists are expected to be announced in the near future. But for now, you can get more artist information and tickets at the festival website or track them on Twitter for the latest updates.","last_modified":"2016-01-25T09:40:00.00Z","sling_resource_type":"geometrixx-media\/components\/page\/article","url":"\/content\/geometrixx-media\/en\/events\/the-lineup-you-ve-been-waiting-for.html","tags":["Concerts","Music"]},{"author":"Scott Reynolds","publishDate":"2012-08-09T04:00:00.00Z","description":"If you attend any festival this year, this is the one to see.","id":"\/content\/geometrixx-media\/en\/events\/the-only-festival-playlist-you-need","title":"The Only Festival Playlist You Need","body":"This years HillyBilly Music Festival is happening NOW!!

It's a question with no objective answer. Some rappers are phenomenal with verses and punchlines but have no knack for hooks or song structure. Some can do all of those things but lack personality. Some never get the production budget they deserve; many do and just have the worst ear for beats. Some fail to capitalize on their buzz, and others are completely incapable of making themselves relevant. And yet, none of that explains why \"Southside Steve\" has been able to consistently make some of the most visceral and intellectually potent hip-hop of the past decade and a half without having a true classic under his belt. On the unimpeachable To Behold, Steve hooks up with last years \"Can you sing?\" runner-up Matt Sobb to create the title track \"While You Are Mine.\" It's a different song with powerful lyrics and doesn't wear out its welcome after a few listens. Limiting himself to one producer, legends-only guest spots, and a real sense that he'd better make this one count, Southside Steve rises to the occasion. You are going to love this album, and though this dude has been around for only three years, he performs so much from the gut that he can\u2019t help but win awards and smoke the competition, acing the Hip Hop Awards for best new artist only six months after a prehensile inception. Then, at the world famous International Hip Hop Challenge, one of the toughest competitions on the globe, he came in second, standing atop a literal mountain of talent from everywhere: North America to Poland to Croatia to Ozzieland and beyond. Not bad for a newby, eh? Well, when you lay an ear to their hot, sticky, greasy, backwoods folk blues sound\u2014yeah, even when he's being alley cat slick\u2014you'll understand. So what's next for Southside Steve? His recording label, Axleman Inc., has renewed his contract to create 3 new albums over the next 2 years. Add to this his gruelling North American touring schedule and a bunch of tours to Europe and you have to wonder what else he has time for. Well, he is hosting the Hip Hop awards show this year where he is nominated for 5 awards. He is also performing at the show with a special surprise guest. Who is the guest? Even Steve doesn't know. You can go to the Hip Hop Awards web site to vote for who you want to see him rap with. Cool idea isn't it? Canada continues to produce musicians with a sound unique to the industry. I first heard this guy at the Hip Hop Music awards a year ago. The producers always invite the best up and coming rappers. I highly recommend a trip to the event. Tickets for the Hip Hop Music Awards gala dinner are available for purchase through the Music Week website. Music Week, proudly celebrating 10 years, is the World's leading annual entertainment event dedicated to the expression and growth of the music, media and entertainment industries. Combining three information-intensive conferences; a trade exposition; a film festival; a comedy festival; four awards shows and the nation's largest New Music Festival \u2013Music Fest \u2013 MW spans a five-day period from March 21 to 25 attracting participants from across the globe.","last_modified":"2016-02-18T03:44:00.00Z","sling_resource_type":"geometrixx-media\/components\/page\/article","url":"\/content\/geometrixx-media\/en\/entertainment\/meet-canada-s-hip-hop-royalty.html","tags":["Concerts","Business","Music"]},{"author":"Keith Mabry","publishDate":"2012-09-08T04:00:00.00Z","description":"We put you in the directors chair in this exclusive exposé","id":"\/content\/geometrixx-media\/en\/entertainment\/behind-the-scenes-with-the-big-heist","title":"Behind The Scenes With The Big Heist","body":"","last_modified":"2012-12-14T21:22:00.00Z","sling_resource_type":"geometrixx-media\/components\/page\/article","url":"\/content\/geometrixx-media\/en\/entertainment\/behind-the-scenes-with-the-big-heist.html","tags":["Movies","Film"]},{"author":"Alison Parker","publishDate":"2012-10-02T04:00:00.00Z","description":"Critics weigh in on what can be expected from on of the most highly anticipated films of the year.","id":"\/content\/geometrixx-media\/en\/entertainment\/new-paladin-trailer-hits-the-screen","title":"New Paladin Trailer Hits The Screen","body":"Mysterious packages, holographic invitations, a trunk full of animal faces and a boy who can run very, very fast...and no, we're not talking about a dream we had after eating too many pickles and chugging a glass of chocolate milk.

But while the combined numbers were off, there were still a few blockbusters that brought fans out in droves. See the biggest hits and misses from May through August. Double Identity Summer started with the superhero team smashing the record for biggest opening ever with a $207 million debut. \"Double Identity\" is now only $40M away from surpassing \"Tablo\" to be the #2 highest-grossing film of all time domestically. And with the movie coming back to theaters for Labor Day weekend, there is a chance it could take it. Warship \"Warship\" was an enormously expensive misfire (reportedly costing over $200 million). The board-game adaptation was more successful internationally than in the U.S. -- it actually made less here than its star Kyle Kitchon's other high-profile bomb \u201CMr. President\" -- but not enough to justify a sequel. Rock and Roll After the success of last year's \"Impossible Mission,\" it looked like Tim Boat\u2019s career was headed for an upswing. But apparently audiences are more interested in watching him hang from skyscrapers than belt out hair-metal tunes. This musical has no chance of making back its reported $75 million budget. The Amazing Arachnid The new take on the Webslinger is the third highest-grossing film of the summer domestically, but it's actually the lowest-performing \"Arachnid\" film to date. Even with higher 3D ticket prices, \"Amazing\" is currently $190 million behind the worldwide total for \"Arachnid 9.\"","last_modified":"2012-12-14T21:22:00.00Z","sling_resource_type":"geometrixx-media\/components\/page\/article","url":"\/content\/geometrixx-media\/en\/entertainment\/summer-blockbuster-hits-and-misses.html","tags":["Movies"]},{"author":"Leonard Duncan","publishDate":"2012-10-30T04:00:00.00Z","description":"","id":"\/content\/geometrixx-media\/en\/gadgets\/paladin-game","title":"Hit show Paladin to be turned into massive online role-playing game","body":"","last_modified":"2016-01-25T10:02:00.00Z","sling_resource_type":"geometrixx-media\/components\/page\/article","url":"\/content\/geometrixx-media\/en\/gadgets\/paladin-game.html","tags":["Movies","Games"]},{"author":"Larry Spiller","publishDate":"2012-11-30T05:00:00.00Z","description":"New trail bike wows our reviewer.","id":"\/content\/geometrixx-media\/en\/gadgets\/sparrow-passes-theendurolifetest","title":"Sparrow passes the Endurolife test","body":"Geometrixx outdoors invited us to the presentation of Sparrow, the latest addition to its stable of enduro bicycles. The manufacturer decided to show us not only its best qualities, but also gave us the opportunity to appreciate the wonderful mountains of the Ticino region: in fact we were guests of Mountain Bike champion Claudio Caluori at the Bike Park that he himself designed on Mount Tamaro where, in 2003, the World Championship was held. The area is located between the intermediate cable car station and the woods to the north and contains nearly 300 km of artificial paths where cyclists can find space for perfecting a great variety of acrobatics. The park is designed to include also paths of various difficulties to challenge cyclists with different skill levels. A great experience is therefore guaranteed here on one of the most beautiful tracks in Switzerland! Sparrow is an all trail enduro bike, so it is truly versatile. I have to say that my first impression, as soon as I got on the saddle, was extremely positive, and it didn't change during the test. The first quality I noticed was its lightness, and it helped me jump and perform acrobatics safely throughout the day: Sparrow weighs only 9.90 kg. The light weight gives the bike great agility going downhill and uphill, and going uphill it climbs easily on uneven ground. With heavier mountain bikes I was often unstable at high speed, but I was pleasantly surprised to discover that Sparrow had no such problem. Thanks to the Syncros AM-2014 710\/25 handlebar andthe Rear Shock Fox Float RP2 Boost Valve Performance XXV suspension, the Shimano Deore XT Shadow Rear Derailleur and the Shimano Deore XT Front Derailleur, I felt good and well-balanced. The lightness of the bike was also a blessing on the ascents, which cost us very little energy, and so we could give a lot more later. Moreover, the suspensions are in titanium. This feature seemed excessive when they first showed it to me, but then I changed my mind: coming down the steepest hills I felt a big difference compared to other bikes I've tried that had suspensions made of other materials. These certainly won't crack after a difficult jump and leave you there on the path with your wheels in the shape of Pringles! The latest generation shifters give great performance: in fact they are Shimano Deore XT Shifters. Throughout the test I was able to manage fatigue easily, and I think they are a real aid for training and increasing stamina... But also for very long rides, when you need to manage your energy wisely. The Avid Elixir 7 brakes also made braking easier and safer and, I can assure you, I exploited them to the fullest! In my opinion, the engineers who chose the materials really did a great job because the bike is also very resistant. Not surprisingly, it is made of a carbon alloy. I'd like to say a word about the Geometrixx outdoors team. The designers, to everybody's astonishment, escorted us all the way \u2013 not only do they know their job very well, but what's even more important, they are also passionate bikers, and it shows! To sum up, at the end of the day I was truly satisfied, and this does not always happen at the end of a test: several times I've thought that a new bike was good overall but still had some critical issues... With Sparrow this was not the case. In addition, I think the price is very affordable, low even, for such high quality. In fact I'm seriously thinking of changing my bike.","last_modified":"2012-12-14T21:26:00.00Z","sling_resource_type":"geometrixx-media\/components\/page\/article","url":"\/content\/geometrixx-media\/en\/gadgets\/sparrow-passes-theendurolifetest.html","tags":["Gadgets"]},{"author":"Alison Parker","publishDate":"2012-11-27T05:00:00.00Z","description":"Read how engineers have leveraged old microprocessors parts to provide new technology for the future.","id":"\/content\/geometrixx-media\/en\/gadgets\/leaps-in-ai","title":"New scientific leaps in artificial intelligence","body":"","last_modified":"2012-12-14T21:25:00.00Z","sling_resource_type":"geometrixx-media\/components\/page\/article","url":"\/content\/geometrixx-media\/en\/gadgets\/leaps-in-ai.html","tags":[]},{"author":"Kerri Saner","publishDate":"2012-11-24T05:00:00.00Z","description":"The top 25 gadgets that will help you stay cool.","id":"\/content\/geometrixx-media\/en\/gadgets\/bored-top-25","title":"Bored?
